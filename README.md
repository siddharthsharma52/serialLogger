# serialLogger
logs data from arduino serial to a file through COM port.

Requirements:
You would need to use the logging module for this. COM port will need to be changed according to your device doing the serial communication.
You can find out the COM port by going to your Windows Device manager and looking up in "ports".


Run serial_logger.py to execute the script. I store the data in two files - one with logging module, the other without it. 


The script can be used for any other device that sends serial data over USB.
